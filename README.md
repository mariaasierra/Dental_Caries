# Dental Caries Microbiome

Microbial Population Shift and Metabolic Characterization of Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) Treatment Failure on Dental Caries.

Saliva and plaque samples were taken. Patients' samples have been classified according to the given condition and treatment: Caries Active, Caries Free, SDF, Non-responders.  Additionally, two different plaque samples were taken: In the caries active tooth and the contralateral tooth in order to identify differences in microbioal communities.

Aims: 

> * Identify bacterial communities associated with the four treatments 
> * Get richness and diversity measures of each group
> * Predict metabolic pathways associated with each group
